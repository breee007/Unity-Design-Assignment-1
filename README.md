# Kids Physics Bedroom 🛏️✨

An interactive simulation of a kid’s bedroom powered by real-time physics!
This project combines playful design with physics-based interactions, letting objects like toys, pillows, and furniture behave naturally when moved, thrown, or collided.

Whether you’re exploring physics engines, designing educational tools, or just having fun building interactive spaces, this project is a great starting point.

## 🎮 Features

* **Physics-based Interactions** – Objects respond to gravity, collisions, and forces.
* **Interactive Bedroom Setup** – Drag, drop, and toss toys, pillows, or furniture.
* **Realistic Behaviors** – Watch balls bounce, blocks topple, or chairs tip over.
* **Kid-Friendly Visuals** – Bright, playful art style to keep things fun and approachable.
* **Extendable Design** – Add your own objects, rules, or educational challenges.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Engine:** [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) (2D physics) or [Unity/Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) (if 3D/2D extended).
* **Frontend:** JavaScript / HTML5 Canvas (or Unity if game-based).
* **Optional:** WebGL rendering for smooth visuals.
